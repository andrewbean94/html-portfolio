 <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
 <p>All around great story telling. I love the non-linear aspect and the soundtrack is amazing</p>

 <h3>Inside Out (1 and 2)</h3>
 <p>The creativity of the story, personifying the human emotions and growing up and how they play different roles. It's also beautifully animated</p>

 <h3>Baby Driver</h3>
 <p>Excellent story and action sequences. The soundtrack is awesome!</p>
